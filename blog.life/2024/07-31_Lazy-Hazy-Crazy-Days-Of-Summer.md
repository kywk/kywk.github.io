# Those Lazy, Hazy, Crazy Days Of Summer

```
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer  
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer

Just fill your basket full of sandwiches and weenies  
Then lock the house up, now you're set  
And on the beach you'll see the girls in their bikinis  
As cute as ever but they never get 'em wet

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer  
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
You'll wish that summer could always be here

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer  
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer

Don't have to tell a girl and fella about a drive-in  
Are some romantic movie scene  
Right from the moment that those lovers start arrivin'  
You'll see more kissin' in the car than on the screen

Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
Those days of soda and pretzels and beer  
Roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer  
You'll wish that summer could always be here

You'll wish that summer could always be here  
You'll wish that summer could always be here
```
