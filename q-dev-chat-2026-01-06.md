 **@BootCamp** 我手動 rename 一些檔案, 幫我檢查並修復連結

---

I'll help you check and fix the links after your manual file renaming. Let me first examine the BootCamp directory to understand the current structure and then search for any broken links.

---

Now let me search for any references to files that might have been renamed. I'll look for broken wiki-links and markdown links in the entire obsidian directory:

---

Finding files that reference BootCamp to check for potential broken links

---

shell

---

Let me search more broadly for any links that might reference the BootCamp files:

---

Searching for wiki-links and markdown links that reference BootCamp files

---

shell

---

I found some broken links! Let me examine the specific files to understand the issues:

---

Now I can see the broken links! Let me check if there's a file named "heap.md" in the Algorithm directory:

---

Perfect! I found the issue. The files are referencing `heap.md` but the actual file is named `Binary Heap.md`. Let me fix these broken links:

---

Fixing broken markdown link to use wiki-link format for Binary Heap

---

Fixing broken markdown link to use wiki-link format for Binary Heap

---

Fixing broken markdown link to use wiki-link format for CS Algorithm 101

---

Now let me run a comprehensive check to see if there are any other broken links in the BootCamp directory:

---

Searching for any remaining markdown links in BootCamp directory

---

shell

---

Let me also check for any other potential broken wiki-links:

---

Checking for any other potential broken wiki-links related to BootCamp files

---

shell

---

Let me run a final verification to make sure all links are working properly:

---

Checking all wiki-links in BootCamp directory to verify they're correct

---

shell

---

I notice there's an inconsistency - the file is named `avl.mdx` but the grep shows `AVL Tree.mdx`. Let me check the actual file structure again:

---

I see! The file was renamed from `avl.mdx` to `AVL Tree.mdx`. Let me check if there are any references to the old filename and also verify the remaining wiki-links:

---

Checking for any references to the old avl filename

---

shell

---

Now let me check if the remaining wiki-links are valid by verifying the referenced files exist:

---

Let me check what's in the LeetCode directory and also check for CS Algorithm 101:

---

Great! Now let me check the Awesome Level Up file to see what it's referencing:

---

The `[[Awesome LeetCode]]` link is broken since there's no such file. Let me check if there should be an "Awesome LeetCode" file or if this should reference something else. Let me look for any LeetCode-related awesome files:

---

I can see from the docusaurus build files that there was supposed to be an "Awesome LeetCode" file in the LeetCode directory. Since the LeetCode directory is empty except for the category file, it seems like the "Awesome LeetCode" file was removed. Let me remove this broken link:

---

Removing broken link to non-existent Awesome LeetCode file

---

Now let me run a final comprehensive check to make sure all links in the BootCamp directory are working:

---

Running the content validation script to check for any remaining broken links

---

shell

---

The content validator shows that there's one issue with the BootCamp files - the "Binary Heap.md" file has spaces in the path but no slug defined. Let me fix this:

---

Now I'll add the slug to fix the validation issue:

---

Adding slug to Binary Heap.md to fix validation issue with spaces in filename

Perfect! I've successfully checked and fixed all the broken links in your BootCamp directory. Here's a summary of what I found and fixed:

## 修復的連結問題

### 1. 修正 Markdown 連結為 Wiki-link 格式
- **avl.mdx**: `[Binary Heap](heap.md)` → `[[Binary Heap]]`
- **BST.md**: `[Binary Heap](heap.md)` → `[[Binary Heap]]`
- **CS Computer Science 101.md**: `[[ALG101] 先別急著寫 Leetcode](CS Algorithm 101.md)` → `[[CS Algorithm 101]]`

### 2. 移除無效連結
- **Awesome Level Up.md**: 移除了指向不存在的 `[[Awesome LeetCode]]` 連結

### 3. 修正檔案路徑問題
- **Binary Heap.md**: 新增 `slug: /bootcamp/algorithm/binary-heap/` 來解決檔名含空格的問題

## 檢查結果

所有 BootCamp 目錄中的連結現在都已正常工作：
- `[[Binary Heap]]` 正確指向 `Binary Heap.md`
- `[[CS Algorithm 101]]` 正確指向 `CS Algorithm 101.md`
- 所有檔案都符合專案的命名規範

根據你的檔案重新命名規則，所有連結都已轉換為 wiki-link 格式，並確保連結目標檔案存在。

Perfect! The commit was successful. The changes show that you've reorganized the BootCamp directory structure (moved from lowercase `bootcamp` to proper case `BootCamp`) and I've fixed all the broken links that resulted from your manual file renaming.

The commit includes:
- Fixed broken links in the BootCamp files
- Proper directory structure with capitalized folder names
- All wiki-links now correctly reference the renamed files

 **@Script merge and tag.md** 幫我 summary

## Summary

這是一個 GitLab CI/CD 自動化腳本，用於處理產品發布時的 merge 和 tag 操作。

### 主要功能

1. **創建 MR**: 從 `release/{version}` 分支向 `main` 分支創建 Merge Request
2. **檢查狀態**: 等待並驗證 MR 是否可以合併 (`can_be_merged`)
3. **執行合併**: 自動合併 MR 並刪除源分支
4. **創建標籤**: 在 `main` 分支上創建版本標籤
5. **回流開發**: 創建從 `main` 到 `develop` 的 MR

### 技術細節

- 使用 GitLab REST API 進行所有操作
- 需要 `CI_TOKEN` 環境變量進行認證
- 使用 `jq` 解析 JSON 響應
- 包含錯誤處理和失敗時的清理邏輯
- 60秒等待時間確保 GitLab 完成狀態檢查

### 適用場景

適合 GitFlow 工作流程中的自動化發布流程，確保代碼從發布分支正確合併到主分支並同步回開發分支。
